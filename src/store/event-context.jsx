"Ideologists arise, not from the ashes but from opportunities"
Being an excellent platform to showcase the research and
ideas, this event has seen considerable amount of growth
since past years, both in terms of its quality and sublime
contribution towards providing nascent engineers a
platform to showcase and present their interest, depth and
research on a topic of their interest. Hence it has evolved as
a NATIONAL LEVEL event, providing budding engineers
across the country to outsmart the rest by their ideas.
